# Monorepo Watch

NOTE: This is a work in progress. Currently it's in its beta state.
Any suggestions are warmly welcomed ðŸ˜„.
<br/>
<br />
A asynchronous, customizable file watcher for projects using lerna, yarn workspaces, and monorepos.

<br/>
<br/>

## Recommended Usage
It is recommended to use terminals that has a at least level=2 support for colors([256 color support](https://nodejs.org/api/tty.html#tty_readstream_setrawmode_mode))

Terminals that support colors are:

1. [Gitbash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
3. [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)
4. [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save monorepo-watch
```

or

```sh
yarn add monorepo-watch
```

<br/>
<br/>

## Usage

1. Create a config file in the root of the project directory.
   </br>
   Eg:

```
packages
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ pkg2
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â””â”€â”€ package.json
package.json
lerna.json
watcher.config.js <--root
```

See [configuration](https://https://github.com/Utkarshk384/monorepo-watch#Configuration) section below on how to configure your watcher.

2. Now run the follow command from any of your packages to get the watcher running.
   <br/>
   As a example, I am running the command from `packages/pkg1`

```sh
npm run watcher -c ../../watcher.config.js -i src
```

The `-c` flag is the config file path and `-i` is the dirs to include.
For multiple dirs use `-i={"src","lib", etc...}`

<br />

This will watch the `src` directory and resolve all it's dependencies and watch its `src` directory as well.

<br/>
<br/>

## Configuration

NOTE: Only [CommonJS](https://medium.com/@cgcrutch18/commonjs-what-why-and-how-64ed9f31aa46) is supported for the config file

```typescript
//watcher.config.js


/**

     *  unlink: (path: string) => any
     *  unlinkDir: (path: string) => any
     * }
     *
